    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Beef Patties</li>
        <li>One tomato</li>
        <li>Half an onion</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>American Cheese Slices</li>
        <li>Burger Buns</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>~3-4 servings</i></p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the tomatos into slices</li>
        <li>Cut the onions into cubes</li>
        <li>Cut the lettuce into slices</li>
        <li>Take a pan, and set it on medium heat</li>
        <li>Take your onions, and cook them until they are really warm and/or a caramel color</li>
        <li>Set aside your onions, and cook your patties</li>
        <li>Make sure to flip them, cooking them until both sides of the patty are brown, with the middle being a dark pink color</li>
        <li>Set the heat to low, and add your cheese on the patties</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If possible, cover the pan so the cheese melts faster</li>

        <li>Now, set aside your patties, and take out your burger buns, and cook them on the pan until they're a golden color</li>
        <li>Take your ingredients, and now build them into a burger!</li>
